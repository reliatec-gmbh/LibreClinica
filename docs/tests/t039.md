T039 known bugs not fitting any other functional category

Abstract: This documents contains the definitions for tests that target bugs not fitting to a functional category. This might be because the functional category (test group) does not exist or because of ambiguity, i. e. could be assigned to more than one test group without clear precedence.  
Please **do not create test numbers** or even worse **test groups** < T100 **on your own**! Instead contact libreclinica.org to get test numbers assigned.
