# General 2-factor authentication configuration

In general 2-factor authentication can be configured within _datainfo.properties_ file. It is deactivated by default to ensure not to break already running systems which upgrade from versions prior LibreClinica 1.2. The following options can be set:

1 2fa.activated

To generally enable 2-factor authentication just adjust the setting like this: _2fa.activated=true_. A restart of the LibreClinica application is required for the changes to take effect.

2 2fa.type

There are two ways how the mandatory authentication code for the authenticator app is provided: APPLICATION (default), LETTER. 

When set to _APPLICATION_ the user themselves are responsible for activating their accounts to use 2-factor authentication. The QR code gets directly displayed within LibreClinica application itself and can directly be scanned with the authenticator app. This settings is more convenient. But please note that this setting does not protect you from [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

When set to _LETTER_ the QR code will be provided within a generated PDF file for printout. The PDF printout can then be made available by project managers via postal order to the according users. Nevertheless, this possibility means more manual work but the _LETTER_ option is a more secure way to avoid potential [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

Administrators are highly recommended to always download the generated PDF file instead of just viewing it within the browser to avoid that the file remains in the local temporary directory and could potentially be viewed by unauthorized third parties.

3 2fa.dueDate

In combination with _2fa.type=LETTER_ this setting can be used to force users to activate 2-factor authentication in the future. If the date has passed, and a user has not activated 2-factor authentication yet, he/she will no longer be able to successfully log in to the system.

Please provide the date in valid [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) format: YYYY-MM-DD

4 Authenticator Apps

There are several solutions of mobile _authenticator apps_ on the market. The most commonly known solutions are _Google Authenticator_ and _Microsoft Authenticator_. But also other solutions will work.

- https://www.apple.com/de/search/authenticator

Note that there is no internet or network needed as authenticator apps are working on a time basis.

# Configuring 2-factor authentication (APPLICATION)

The following workflow describes the procedure how _LibreClinica_ users can activate their account for 2-factor authentication.

Just log in to the system and click on _Tasks_ -> _Update Profile_. When switching _Authentication Type_ to _2-Factor Authentication_ the _QR-Code_ button gets visible. Click it to generate the QR code and scan it with your authenticator app on your mobile device. When successfully scanned the changes have to be confirmed by pressing _Confirm Profile Changes_ to finally update your profile changes.

From now on login to the system will only be granted when providing the valid additional number code created by the authenticator app. The code will only be valid for about 30 seconds.

Users are recommended to rename the scanned 2-factor profile within their authenticator app to ensure uniqueness when working with multiple _LibreClinica_ instances.

# Configuring 2-factor authentication (LETTER)

The following workflow describes the procedure how administrators can activate a user's account for 2-factor authentication.

Create a new or edit an existing user account. Then assign the _Marked for 2-Factor Authentication_ as _Authentication Type_.

After persisting the changes got to  _Tasks -> Users_  and click the printer icon for the specific user to generate a PDF printout.

Provide the PDF printout or the original file itself to the user via postal order or transmission via a secure way. At the end the generated file should permanently be deleted.

# Configuring login e-mail notification

The following workflow describes the procedure how e-mail notifications can be activated for a study. 
Create a new or edit an existing study. Here notifications can be enabled for the whole study including all sites. 
It is possible to specify the e-mail address for the project management, which is referenced in every notification e-mail.
![administrator home](administrator-manual_images/update_study_details.png "update study details")

After persisting the changes, everytime a user logs in to the study or connected site a notification e-mail is send.
The notification e-mail contains information regarding study/site, date, time and contact address of the project management.

# Providing manuals for download

To provide PDF manuals for download in the applications Tasks menu for the roles _Administrator_, _Investigator_ or _Monitor_ the _display.manual_ setting has to be set to true (default is false) in the datainfo.properties config file. Please note that the distribution has to be build with the _include-pdf-manuals_ Maven profile (passed to `mvn clean package` by `-Pinclude-pdf-manuals`). With _exclude-pdf-manuals_ the PDF manuals are not generated and not part of the distribution.

Independently of this feature the online manuals at libreclinica.org can be reached by following the "Documentation" link at the bottom of the application's pages.
